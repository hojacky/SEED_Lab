This will be the area where code for the SEED Lab project will be placed. 
This will allow all the team members to share code with each other easily. 
Several subfolders will be made to hold code for each demonstration, leading up to the final demonstration.

The Mini_Project file contains all the code and versions of code for the mini project democstration. The mini project prompt was to detect a quadrant from the camera on the Pi, then send that quadrant to the arduino and move a motor which turns one wheel of the robot to that quadrant

The Demo 1 file contains all the code for the demo 1 project. In demo 1 the team constructed the robot with two back wheels and one front wheel. The team also created code that would detect an aruco marker from the Pi, and then send back the postion relative to the Pi. The Arduino took in a specific distance and angle, and rotated the motors for the two wheels which took the robot to that specific distance and angle.

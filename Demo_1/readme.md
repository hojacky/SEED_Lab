Demo 1:

The team built the remainder of the robot, with two motorized back wheels and one non-motorized front wheel. The team also coded the Pi to recognize a markers postion relative 
to its own position, and display that position on the LCD. The team also programmed the robot to travel a specific distance in feet and then stop, as well as turn a specific 
number of degrees then travel forward one foot and stop.

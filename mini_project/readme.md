Mini Project:

In this project, the team built one side of the robot with one wheel. The team coded the wheel to rotate to a specific quadrant that was provided by the raspberry Pi. 
The raspberry Pi detected the aruco marker through the aruco marker detection scheme, then sent the quadrant number to the Arduino, which then uses a feedback loop to 
calculate error and turn the wheel.

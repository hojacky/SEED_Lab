#-------------STATE MACHINE ----------------#
class State():  # This machine is the Master and will be sending commands to the arduino to execute 

  def locate():
  # Find location? I am actually kind of unsure abt this one

  def turning(): # We will have the arduino ready to read-in either a 1,2,3 code and if it recieives a one it enters the loop to turn, etc. 
  
  #Send Code 1 to indicate it is about to send angle to turn
  #Send Angle value to Arduino to command it to turn

  def straight():
  #Send Code 2 to indicate it is about to go straight and send distance
  #Send distance 
 
  def endit():
  # Send code 3 so it knows it will be disabling motors 
  # Send values to disable motors
  #Execute LCD display
